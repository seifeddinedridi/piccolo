## Piccolo: experimental toy compiler
Piccolo is a work in progress toy programming language. The purpose of the project is to provide an educational playground for anyone who wants to learn how to write their own compilers.

In this current state, the compiler can recognize basic arithmetic expressions, value assignment to variable, and functions definitions. It only supports generation of an Abstract Syntax Tree but there is a plan to add a basic interpreter and possibly a module for compiling code into a binary representation.
