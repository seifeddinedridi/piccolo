## Piccolo: experimental toy compiler
Piccolo is a work-in-progress toy programming language. The purpose of this project is to provide an educational playground for anyone who is interested to learn about how to write their own compiler.

The compiler in its current state can recognize basic arithmetic expressions, variables and functions definitions. For now the compiler can only generate an Abstract Syntax Tree but there is a plan in the future to add a basic interpreter and possibly a module for binary code generation.
